# CASA0018-Apple-Classification

## Introduction
Being able to correctly identify apple type, fruit type, and other shopping items is important for improving the self-service experience in supermarkets. The future of supermarket self-checkouts will involve ai kiosks using computer vision to correctly label food items without the need for barcode scanning or manually inputting your order and quantity into the self-checkout kiosk. This AI approach helps to reduce the queue times in the self-checkout zone. 

Supermarkets in the United Kingdom have approximately Â£3.2 of goods stolen annually at the self-checkout. The use of computer-vision techniques in self-checkout kiosks could introduce new preventative measures against theft. Missed scans comprise a large portion of how goods go unpaid. 20-30% of missed scans are intentional. Customers also attempt to dupe the system by weighing an incorrect item for a lower price. The use of computer vision helps to reduce missed scans and catch customers aiming to trick the system (Gitnux, 2023).
